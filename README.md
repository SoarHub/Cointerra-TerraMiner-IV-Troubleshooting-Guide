Cointerra TerraMiner IV Troubleshooting Guide
=============================================

Owner Contributed Information

The goal of this guide is to consolidate known solutions to problems encountered with Cointerra's TerraMiner IV bitcoin miners.
We are not experts on the product but rather owners who wish to share solutions to the problematic miners.

Various sources of help are available on the web however reading through lengthy threads trying to find a solution to your problem is very time consuming.
For those who are familiar, once Cointerra shut down their hosted forum, owners lost the ability to collaborate - along with tons of valuable information.  
If anyone has a local copy of that forum, we could incorporate the important parts into this guide.
